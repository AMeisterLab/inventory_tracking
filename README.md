# **How a Simple Spreadsheet Became a Meal Coordination Lifesaver**

I’ll never forget the day I walked into the kitchen of the meal delivery service where I work. Pots were clanging, and chefs were moving swiftly, but amidst all the hustle and bustle, I noticed something troubling: no one seemed to know exactly what meals were available or how many. It then hit me that we needed a better way to manage our inventory. This project was born out of that realization, and it turned out to be an exciting journey filled with learning and surprises.

**Why THIS Project?**

I chose this project because it addressed a significant problem we faced daily. The kitchen and the distribution center were like two ships passing in the night, often missing each other’s signals. With clients having diverse meal preferences, it became increasingly challenging to allocate meals efficiently. By streamlining the communication of available meals, I hoped to make both planning and packing smoother. This project was not just about spreadsheets; it was about ensuring our clients received exactly what they wanted and eased tension between the kitchen and distribution employees.

**Key Takeaways**

  **Inventory Tool**

•	Developed a tool to streamline meal allocation and inventory tracking.

•	Created user-friendly macros to assist those less familiar with Excel.

•	Tracked meal preferences and inventory trends over time.

  **Inventory Analysis**

•	On average, there were 173 meals pulled per week. With each client receiving 7 meals/week this equates to serving ~25 clients/week. 

•	During the month of May there were, on average, 21 different meal options to choose from compared to June which only offered 12 different meals to choose from. While the variety has decresed from May to June, this still allows clients to receive 7 unique meals each week with some room to accomodate preferences and makes managing the selections easier.  

•	Across May and June, 17 different dishes were prepared (4 Chicken, 4 Beef, 4 Other, 2 Pork, and 3 Seafood) with a total of 996 individual meals prepared. 

**Details**

The content I worked with included client names, the number of meals they needed, their meal preferences, and a list of meals and quantity available. 

**Analysis Process**

My first step was building macros that allowed the primary user—who wasn’t very familiar with Excel—to easily navigate the tool and begin tracking inventory. One of the most rewarding aspects was creating a function that automatically updated the inventory after meals were allocated and generated an email to stakeholders, which brought clarity to our operations. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this function worked and how quickly we could track inventory changes.

**Visuals and Insights**

The meal selector tool can be used to allocate meals to each client according to preference and availabilty. Once meals are allocated, the summarized quantities can be used when pulling meals from the freezers to pack. Finally, once the meals are packed, the user can send an email with the updated inventory to the kitchen staff and reset the meal selector for the next week using the buttons in the top right corner.

As we began to send out weekly emails summarizing our inventory, I noticed fascinating trends. For example, this visual shows the number of different meals allocated by type—chicken, beef, pork, seafood, other. This data helped us understand what kind of meals are currently in inventory and how we might add variety in future meal planning.

This chart illustrates the number of meals distributed by type over the last two months. Notice how pork consistently underperforms other options, indicating a strong client preference against pork based meals.

**Main Takeaways**

This project taught me more than just the technical aspects of Excel; it helped me grasp the importance of clear communication in a business setting. The ability to track inventory trends not only improved our meal distribution but also provided invaluable insights into client preferences, helping us tailor our offerings.

**Conclusion and Personal Reflections**

In wrapping up, this project not only improved our operations but also instilled a sense of pride in the work we do. I was thrilled to see how a simple tool could make such a significant difference. It has inspired me to continue looking for ways to innovate in my role.
